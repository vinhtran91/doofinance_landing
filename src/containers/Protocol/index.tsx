                        Our dead wallet is like a holder, and it receives a part of 4% that is redistributed to all holders in every transaction but instead of keeping the tokens it just burns ðŸ”¥ automatically, which means we are a deflationary token.

                        Holders of our token can be rewarded simply by holding the token by 2% of every transaction, which is a form of in-wallet staking that does not require tokens to be locked.
